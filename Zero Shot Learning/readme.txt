If running offline on your system, then please change the 'folder location' in cell-3.
example. folder_location = 'F:\\CS771\\homework\\hw1\\data\\AwA_python\\'

If you are running the code on google colab and have the data on google drive,
then please UNCOMMENT the cell-1 in the programs and update the 'folder_location' variable in cell-3 accordingly.
example. folder_location = '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/hw1/data/AwA_python/'

Address should be such that the npy files should be just inside the rightmost folder. In this case, it was AwA_python for me.
